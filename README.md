Application for listing cloud related questions.

This is a simple application that returns a list of cloud related questions. I wrote it to learn Lambda which turns out to be quite easy. I also wrote it as a "keeping up" with cloud technology by forcing myself to write questions and answers on AWS and GCP.

The questions are stored in Dynamodb and the application logic is written and Python running under AWS Lambda, the view is written in Angualr JS.  I will probably re-write it in GoLang as part of the process of learning that particular Language.

You can see it in action here

it used to be on noserver.online but I forgot to renew the domain and the registrar wanted silly money to recover it.
